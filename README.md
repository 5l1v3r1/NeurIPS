## People are upset by the acronym "NIPS"

It might be offensive to some.

Or it might be annoying to others (try searching for "NIPS" in Google image search... It's not about the conference.

This is to host the conference content under a different acronym to avoid those problems for now until the board catches up

Just because the conference name hasn't changed doesn't mean the acronym has to stay.
