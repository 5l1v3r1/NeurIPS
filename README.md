# NeurIPS Content Mirror

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰This used to hold the content for a mirror of the Neural Information Processing Systems conference under a different acronym. As of Nov 16, the official conference has changed its official working acronym and www.neurips.com now redirects to the main site (neurips.cc) and is in the process of being transferred over to the NeurIPS Foundation.ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

See: https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2018/Press

Medium post that explained this mirror which originally was hosted at www.neurips.com (for posterity): https://medium.com/@breakend/neurips-2018-10abf2f56dca

## People are upset by the acronym "NIPS"

It might be offensive to some.

Or it might be annoying to others (try searching for "NIPS" in Google image search... It's not about the conference).

This is to host the conference content under a different acronym to avoid those problems for now until the board catches up

Just because the conference name hasn't changed doesn't mean the acronym has to stay.

## NeurIPS board

The domain name can be transferred over whenever, just reach out!


## Changing the name entirely might not be a bad idea also...
